\#1

Hello everyone, welcome to Beginners Guide to Filecoin Chapter 4 

In this video, I will help you to better understand 

Who first gave the idea of Ethereum

The development and milestones of Ethereum

And Popular uses of Ethereum

Here we go

\#2 **Overview** 

**Ethereum** is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. 

**Ether** (Abbreviation: **ETH**) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. 

Among cryptocurrencies, ether is second only to bitcoin in market capitalization.

\#3 **History** 

Let's start with discovering the history of **Ethereum.**

**Ethereum** was initially described in late 2013 in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, that described a way to build decentralized applications.

In 2013, Buterin briefly worked with eToro CEO Yoni Assia on the Colored Coins project and drafted its white paper outlining additional use cases for blockchain technology.

Ethereum was announced at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January 2014.

Ethereum has an unusually long list of founders. 

**Anthony Di Iorio** wrote: "Ethereum was initially founded by Vitalik Buterin, Myself, Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alisie & Amir Chetrit in December 2013. Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, & Jeffrey Wilcke were added in early 2014 as founders." 

**Buterin** chose the name Ethereum after browsing a list of elements from science fiction on Wikipedia. 

He stated, "I immediately realized that I liked it better than all of the other alternatives that I had seen; I suppose it was the fact that it sounded nice and it had the word 'ether', referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel." 

Buterin wanted his platform to be the underlying and imperceptible medium for the applications running on top of it.

2014 is the year of Ethereum Development.

Formal development of the software underlying Ethereum began in early 2014 through a Swiss company, Ethereum Switzerland GmbH The idea of putting executable smart contracts in the blockchain needed to be specified before it could be implemented in software. 

This work was done by Gavin Wood, then the chief technology officer, in the Ethereum Yellow Paper that specified the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 

Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the **Ethereum Foundation**  was founded. 

**#5**

Several codenamed prototypes of Ethereum were developed over 18 months in 2014 and 2015 by the Ethereum Foundation as part of their **proof-of-concept** **series**. "**Olympic**" was the last prototype and public beta pre-release. The Olympic network gave users a bug bounty of 25,000 ether for stress-testing the Ethereum blockchain. 

On 30 July 2015, "**Frontier**" marked the official launch of the Ethereum platform, and Ethereum created its "genesis block". The genesis block contained 8,893 transactions allocating various amounts of ether to different addresses, and a block reward of 5 ETH.

Since the initial launch, Ethereum has undergone a number of planned protocol upgrades, which are important changes affecting the underlying functionality and/or incentive structures of the platform. Protocol upgrades are accomplished by means of a hard fork.

\#6

In 2016, a decentralized autonomous organization called **The** **DAO**—a set of smart contracts developed on the platform—raised a record US$150 million in a crowd sale to fund the project. The DAO was exploited in June 2016 when US$50 million of DAO tokens were stolen by an unknown hacker. The event sparked a debate in the crypto-community about whether Ethereum should perform a contentious "hard fork" to reappropriate the affected funds.

The fork resulted in the network splitting into two blockchains: 

**Ethereum with theft reversed**, and **Ethereum Classic,** which continued on the original chain. 

The hard fork created a rivalry between the two networks. After the hard fork, Ethereum subsequently forked twice in the fourth quarter of 2016 to deal with other attacks.

\#7

From 2017 to now, Filecoin never stopped its development.

In March 2017, various blockchain startups, research groups, and *Fortune* *500* companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with 30 founding members. By May 2017, the nonprofit organization had 116 enterprise members.

By January 2018, ether was the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, behind bitcoin. As of 2021, it maintained that relative position.

After the Constantinople upgrade on 28 February 2019, there were two network upgrades made within a month late in the year: Istanbul on 8 December 2019 and Muir Glacier on 2 January 2020.

There were **two network upgrades** in 2021. 

The first was "**Berlin**", implemented on 14 April 2021. 

The second was "**London**", which took effect on 5 August. The London upgrade included Ethereum Improvement Proposal ("EIP") 1559, a mechanism for reducing transaction fee volatility. 

The mechanism causes a portion of the ether paid in transaction fees for each block to be destroyed, rather than given to the miner, reducing the inflation rate of ether and potentially resulting in periods of deflation.

While Ethereum kept developing, it came to Ethereum 2.0...

**Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2)** was a set of **three or more upgrades**, also known as "**phases**", meant to transition the network's consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake, and to scale the network's transaction throughput with execution sharding and improved EVM architecture. 

**The first** of these three upgrades, also known as "**phase 0**", launched the **proof-of-stake Beacon Chain** on the 1st of December, 2020.

In early **2022**, the “Ethereum 2.0” terminology was deprecated in an effort to highlight the existence of only one Ethereum network and one ether cryptocurrency. As a result of the effort, the **Eth1** **blockchain** was renamed to the “**execution layer**”, and its associated Eth1 clients were reclassified as execution clients. Similarly, the Eth2 blockchain was renamed to the "**consensus layer**", and its associated Eth2 clients were reclassified as consensus clients.

On 15 September **2022**, Ethereum transitioned its **consensus mechanism** from **proof-of-work** (PoW) to **proof-of-stake** (PoS) in an upgrade process known as "**the Merge**". This has cut Ethereum's energy usage by **99%**.

\#9 **Design**

The design of Ethereum might be a little bit complicated, ill not illustrate it here in the video. 

but for those of you who may be interested, you are welcome to pause and review more detailed information.

\#10 **Applications**

Ethereum allows anyone to deploy permanent and immutable decentralized applications onto it, with which users can interact. **Decentralized finance** **(****DeFi****)** applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks, such as allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for interest. 

Ethereum also allows users to create and exchange **NFTs**, which are unique tokens representing ownership of an associated asset or privilege, as recognized by any number of institutions. 

Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies utilize the **ERC-20 token** standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin offerings.

\#11 **Applications**

Here are the most famous and essential applications built on Ethereum:

- **Contract** **source code****:** Ethereum's smart contracts are written in high-level programming languages and then compiled down to EVM bytecode and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. 
- **ERC-20 tokens**: The ERC-20 Token Standard allows for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts that correctly implement ERC-20 processes are called ERC-20 Token Contracts, and they keep track of created tokens on Ethereum. Numerous cryptocurrencies have launched as ERC-20 tokens and have been distributed through initial coin offerings.
- **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**: Ethereum also allows for the creation of unique and indivisible tokens, called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Since tokens of this type are unique, they have been used to represent such things as collectibles, digital art, sports memorabilia, virtual real estate, and items within games.
- **Decentralized finance**: Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers traditional financial instruments in a decentralized architecture, outside of companies' and governments' control, such as money market funds which let users earn interest. DeFi applications are typically accessed through a Web3-enabled browser extension or application, such as MetaMask, which allows users to directly interact with the Ethereum blockchain through a website. Many of these DApps can connect and work together to create complex financial services.
