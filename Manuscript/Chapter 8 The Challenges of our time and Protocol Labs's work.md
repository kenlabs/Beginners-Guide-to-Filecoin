Hello everyone, welcome to Beginners Guide to Filecoin Chapter 8

In this video, I'll give you a sense of **Protocol Labs**

what protocol labs **heading.**

And its **open-source contribution****.**

Here we go

\#2 **Protocol Lab Background: the challenges of our time**

The advent of computing radically transformed humanity, and so has the flourishing of our global nervous system, that's the Internet. 

This still-nascent medium of communication, of digital existence, will connect us and empower us in ways we've only begun to understand. 

In just a few short decades we've acquired tremendous, almost magical superpowers: 

we can speak to half the planet, at any time and from almost anywhere; 

we can explore and search for the most complete compendium of human knowledge in seconds; 

we can reason about and solve tremendously difficult problems; 

we can work, play, and be together at a distance; 

we can conjure systems of digital and mechanical agents to do our bidding; 

we can change the world, we can save lives, we can wield all the powers of our species, for good and bad, 

**with a sequence of keystrokes.**

And yet, this is only the beginning of computing's impact on humanity. 

It's hard to understand that human life was quite different decades ago, harder still to grasp how fundamentally different we are from our ancestors thousands of years in the past. We're living during a radical phase transition in the history of life and intelligence on Earth, and computation is a breakthrough in the order of genetic evolution.

The horizon of computing is exciting and turbulent. We face optimistic progress, significant challenges, and a host of existential threats. 

\#3 **Protocol Lab Background: the challenges of our time**

Protocol labs navigate this complex landscape by grounding themselves in two important goals.

First, protocol labs should improve the internet and computing generally.

Secure and robust access to information, communication, and to computing has become a critical part of what it means to be a modern human. The internet has become the main vehicle for human interactions worldwide, and it will only become more so as their devices and interfaces improve. Brain-machine interfaces will cement this, and those are not so far away. Therefore, fixing problems with the internet and upgrading their computational fabric will have a tremendous impact on humanity now and in the future. This is the Why.

And second, protocol labs should accelerate the ideas-to-superpowers pipeline.

At the heart of computing progress lies a simple process: the research, development, and deployment cycle. Ideas are conceived and refined, encoded into mathematical rules, programmed into software, and deployed into computers, which grants superpowers to humans worldwide. The better and faster Protocol Lab is at sifting ideas through this pipeline, the better and faster their superpowers will come. This is the How.

Protocol Labs is a research, development, and deployment lab for network protocols. protocol labs believe the internet is humanity’s most important technology. Their mission is to improve the internet and computing, generally. protocol labs are doing so by creating groundbreaking protocols, and speeding up the pipeline from ideas on paper to users’ hands. 

\#4 **Protocol Labs** 

For your better understanding, let me give you more detailed introduction of Protocol Labs:

Protocol Labs was founded in May 2014, by Huan Benet, inventor of IPFS and Filecoin. 

That summer, Protocol Lab participated in the YCombinator program (S14). Protocol Labs released IPFS to the world in January 2015. 

Since then, IPFS has gained enormous traction in a variety of industries and organizations. 

By 2016, IPFS grew to be one of the most used and relied-on technologies in the Blockchain industry, and hailed by thousands of developers as "The Future of the Web." 

That year, Protocol Labs also created libp2p, IPLD, multiformat, Orbit, and a number of other projects. 

Their most anticipated project is Filecoin. The Filecoin mainnet was officially launched for public use in October 2020. 

And the FEVM was introduced to the Filecoin mainnet on 14 March 2023, enabling smart contracts and user programmability.

Protocol Labs at its core consists of an organization (also referred to internally as Starfleet) that supports open-source software projects, engineering research in multiple fields related to computation, communication, and knowledge, as well as other services for a network of organizations that builds upon and expands the capabilities of the core technologies.

Protocol Labs exists to enable a network of projects, tools, startups, research, communities (and more) that are springing up and evolving around new protocols and web3 technologies. As this ecosystem grows, these projects invest in the network itself, and the network grows along with it, which in turn benefits and incentivizes this ongoing evolution.

Then what is **Protocol Labs Vision & Mission?**

Protocol Labs drives breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward.

Protocol Labs has

- Ideas for the super-power **pipeline.**
- A **network** is capable of repeatable innovation.
- World-class **teams** & **network**.

\#5 **Protocol Labs Projects** 

*In Protocol Labs, there are new projects and technologies being invented every day. Keep in mind that this may not be a comprehensive list of all important projects growing in their network*

- **IPFS** is one of the original core OSS projects, from which other projects in Protocol Labs have grown and nucleated, creating a network of Open Source technologies, developer tooling, DApps, and more.
- **Filecoin** is the other original core organization that supports the builders and storage providers that use Protocol Labs & Filecoin technologies. Filecoin is a utility token (cryptocurrency) that supports and incentivizes the growth of our network of web3 technologies.
- **libp2p** is a set of modular tools for networking and peer-to-peer communications
- **IPLD** is the data model that is used for the content-addressable web
- **Multiformat** is a project that makes it possible to create self-describing data, which allows protocols and projects to be interoperable and future-proof
- **Test ground** is a platform for testing, benchmarking, and simulating distributed and peer-to-peer systems at a scale that can scale from 2k-10k instances
- **Drand** is a revolutionary public, distributed, verifiable randomness generator that can be used in protocols and cryptocurrencies that require public randomness.
- **Filecoin** **Virtual Machine** **(FVM)** is a layer 1 protocol that will enable developers to create and execute smart contracts on data stored in the Filecoin network
- **Lotus** is the main Filecoin network implementation, supported by Filecoin, written in Go & maintained by the PL team

\#6  **Protocol Labs Network**

Protocol Labs is a constantly evolving network made up of 450+ projects, companies, and organizations. 

This Protocol Labs portal is the central point of reference for all the resources available to PLN members. This portal includes information about Network Services from Mosaia, the network directory, and communication channels as well.

**Directories and Key Resources** 

- [Spaceport](https://coda.io/d/Protocol-Labs-Spaceport_dDpJBnYeqJb/What-is-Spaceport_suSQ9#_luhKz) is a network-wide directory and guide for those navigating the Protocol Labs web3 space with many links to resources for PL Network members, including:

\#7 **Protocol Labs Culture**

Protocol Labs is building the next generation of the internet. Protocol Lab is an open-source network that spans research into development pipelines to create new protocols, tools, and services to radically improve the Internet. Their products serve thousands of organizations and millions of people.

Many teams in the PL Network are fully distributed and follow a common set of open-source practices to grow and flourish together. This distributed, open-source philosophy is at the core of how Protocol Lab operates.

Protocol Lab also believes in connection, and bringing people together to inspire innovation. That’s why Protocol Lab has yearly PL Network “Lab Weeks” to gather their community of “labbers” (contributors and members of PL Network teams) together and align on the next year’s opportunities and challenges.

PL was a fully-remote company. Below, let me gather wisdom from the protocol labs team on how to thrive in a remote work environment:

**Spend time composing clear, concise, and effective communication**

To help overcome the difficulties posed by asynchronous work, remote workers should prioritize clear, concise, effective communication. For example, if you’re communicating with someone eight time zones away, avoid simple “yes” or “no” questions – you’ll wait eight hours to get a response, and you’ll likely want to ask a follow-up. Spend time thinking about how to frame your questions – “If yes, then what? If no, then what?” works well – to avoid long delays between emails.

**Be mindful of information overload**

Another issue posed by remote work is information overload. To address that, Protocol Lab created their company handbook, the goal of which is to be the single source of information for everything Labbers need to know in order to be successful here at Protocol Labs.

**Maximize the efficacy of synchronous meetings**

There is a time and purpose for synchronous meetings. Examples include high-bandwidth bidirectional communication for brainstorming or for decision-making. For these meetings, Protocol Lab uses **Zoom** video conferencing software.

**Find your virtual water cooler**

It’s easy to underestimate the importance of workplace friendships. But studies show that healthy, supportive social interactions with work friends are **key to building a successful team.**

In general, Open Source Software is at the core of Protocol Labs.

At the end of 2022, Protocol Labs consist of 450+ companies and projects built on their network. As the Web3 space accelerates, now is a great time for high-growth researchers & developers inside and outside Web3 to ramp up their “InterPlanetary” knowledge and contribute to these cutting-edge technologies.

From core OSS contribution, to Radius grants distributed systems engineers, to network researchers, to community managers, to startup operators, there are a vast number of exciting opportunities across PLN teams and companies.
